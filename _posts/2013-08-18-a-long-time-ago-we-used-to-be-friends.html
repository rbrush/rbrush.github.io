No one ever intends to let their blogs go dark, but here we are. &nbsp;I'm planning on dusting off this blog to write about some new personal projects, but for now I thought I'd link to writing I've done in other venues:<br /><br />

I've written a few posts for <a href="https://engineering.cerner.com/">Cerner's Engineering blog</a> as part of my work at Cerner. These include:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://engineering.cerner.com/2013/02/composable-mapreduce-with-hadoop-and-crunch/">Composable MapReduce with Hadoop and Crunch</a></li><li><a href="https://engineering.cerner.com/2013/02/near-real-time-processing-over-hadoop-and-hbase/">Near Real-time Processing Over Hadoop and HBase</a></li><li><a href="https://engineering.cerner.com/2013/07/thinking-in-mapreduce/">Thinking in MapReduce</a></li></ul><div>Some of this content is from talks that I've given at Hadoop World, ApacheCon, and StampedeCon.<br /><br />Some ideas originally posted to this blog have been published in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Things-Every-Programmer-Should-Know/dp/B00CVDXWV8">97 Things Every Programmer Should Know</a>. <br /><br />My latest personal project has been the construction of a <a href="https://github.com/rbrush/clara-rules">forward-chaining rules engine in Clojure</a>. I expect this and related problems to be the emphasis on this blog moving forward.</div>
