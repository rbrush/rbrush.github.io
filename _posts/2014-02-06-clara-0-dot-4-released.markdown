Clara 0.4 has been released, and is available on Clojars! See the [github page](https://github.com/rbrush/clara-rules) for usage information. I wrote about the significant features in the [Rules as Data](/blog/2014/01/19/rules-as-data/) post.

The [release announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/bvs9zQMDpNg) is in the Clojure Google Group.

This release puts Clara on a strong footing, and I'm looking forward to playing with the new rules-as-data features.
