The problem with experts is they're too smart.  The problem with the rest of us is we don't have the expertise to reign in the experts.<br /><br />Consider the following conversation:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mortal Developer:</span> This system seems complicated.  Can we do without the WhackAMole feature?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expert: </span>No, some clients might need WhackAMole to interact with their legacy abacus.<br /><br />Now our poor mortal developer is stumped.  After all, this is the <span style="font-style: italic;">expert</span> we're talking to here -- and if he says we need WhackAMole you better get whacking.<br /><br />

What our developer missed is this: <span style="font-style: italic;">complexity alone is enough to reject a design.</span>  After all, you're a smart engineer with years of programming experience.  Even if you're not an expert, if a system is hard for you to comprehend, it's probably too complicated.  Sadly, there seems to be an "Emperor's New Clothes" phenomenon in software  -- no one wants to admit something is hard to understand.<br /><br />This shouldn't be surprising -- objecting to complexity might be viewed as looking stupid in an industry where intelligence is the highest virtue.  Unfortunately this can do a lot of harm.  Imagine if the J2EE specification had involved a developer without expertise, but with veto power.  Surely the result would have been a lot simpler.  This lesson may have been learned for newer versions, but once added this complexity cannot be completely removed.<br /><br />For anyone that might be struggling with this right now, some humble advice:<br /><ul><li>Follow Alan Kay's axiom: "Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible." -- If something complicated <span style="font-style: italic;">must </span>be in the system, it still should not affect the simple things.</li></ul><ul><li>View the project as a constant battle against complexity -- A single complex module may seem unimportant, but it quickly compounds.</li></ul><ul><li>Understand a project end-to-end -- the project should be easily broken down into problems that are known to be solvable.  (Avoid Southpark's 1. Collect Underpants. 2. ??? 3. Profit!!!).   </li></ul><ul>   <li>       A strong-willed engineer or executive can will a group down the wrong path -- it's an engineer's duty to object and prevent spiraling complexity</li></ul><ul><li>The clever hack should be a last resort -- a hack that is hard to come up with is much harder to debug or support<br /></li></ul>All of this boils down to Keep It Simple, Stupid.  It turns out keeping things simple is pretty hard.<br /><br />Update: This isn't to suggest that all experts fall into this trap, but there is certainly evidence suggesting that <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> do.
