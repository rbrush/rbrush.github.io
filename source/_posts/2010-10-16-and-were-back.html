After an unbelievably long hiatus, I'm going to start blogging again.  It's funny how becoming a parent makes everything else seem to go away for a while.<div><br /></div><div>I don't expect I will ever post at a regular intervals here.  I'll post when I feel like I can express something that gets closer to some truth about software -- at least to me.   How often will that happen?  Who knows?</div><div><br /></div><div>The rebirth of this blog will come with a shift in material, at least for the near future.  I've recently become more interested in the social aspect of building software.  How should we organize ourselves to create great software?  How should that change over time?</div><div><br /></div><div>I am and always will be a programmer at heart.  My shift in emphasis simply comes from the realization that our biggest challenges aren't technical.  They're social.</div>
